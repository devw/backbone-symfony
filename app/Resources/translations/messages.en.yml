            I wanted to say thank you for fixing the coffee machine yesterday. Thanks to you I had my coffee cup this
            morning and it made me feel so good that I worked twice as hard to finish the project. We should be able to
            launch this spaceship to Mars tomorrow.

            Dear Chuck Norris,

            Thank you for saving the World once again yesterday. I appreciate that you are always here to help us out
            of very critical situations and to distribute a bunch of kicks to bad guys. Thanks to you the World is a
            much better place.

            I can no other answer make, but, thanks, and thanks. Your contribution to Project Superman has been
            invaluable. I especially appreciate your magic powers which made us finish the project in 2 weeks instead of
            3 months.

            Just wanted to thank you for being on time every morning. It seems obvious but you are here on time every
            single day and it makes me feel good to know that we can always start our morning meeting right on time.

            Hi %first_name%,

            Thank you for signing-up to HighFive. **It takes just two simple steps** to get started with HighFive. Then
            you'll be able to start engaging your team and recognize and showcase the good work.

                Self HighFiving is useless! You need to invite at least some people from your team to be able to use HighFive properly and get some value from it.

            title: 2. Send some HighFives
            content: |
                After you've invited people and they have joined your organization, you can send them HighFives. HighFives are small positive recognition messages sent to appreciate and promote good work or good behaviors which impact your company positively.
        why_highfive:
            title: How to HighFive properly?
            content: |
                At HighFive, we think HighFives must be **sincere** and **specific**. Don't tell people that they are great. They probably won't believe you.
                Tell them that **YOU** want to thank them for a **VERY SPECIFIC** reason.

                There are plenty of excellent reasons to send a HighFive: a sales rep has exceeded his objectives, a developer has fixed an annoying bug, a newcomer has joined the organization, a guy in your team is there on time every morning...

                Don't forget to appreciate exceptional behaviors as well as unexceptional but good behaviors. Also describe the consequences of these behaviors for the company.

                **Have questions or need help getting started? Just reply to this email and we're happy to help!**
